+ Exploration:
    - more decoupling?
    - multiple boxes configurations: merged or separate?
- Radial: to factorise
- BoxVolumeChange -> BoxSizeChange?
- MaximumBoxCompression: avoid r_min /= min_distance confusion
- HardContact: NeighbourCells size must be increased: drawback
- DipolarVisitor: Self is scalable (instead of O(N)): is it worth it?
- In DESreciStructure & DESreciVisitor, document the role of boxVolumeMemento
- doc: permittivity: \epsilon -> \varepsilon
- VolumeChange: + or - in observable?
- Generalise ParticleInsertionMethod (Widom) for other ensembles, cf. FS02
- Convert all explorations for multiples boxes & components
- ExploringAlgorithms: warning if unexpected ensemble
- There are at least two versions of GEMC: ``Canonical'' & ``Isobaric''. I will
    implement the first one.
- NeighbourCells: HS shortcut
- realZero: relative if possible
- PLMCgenerate: changesTuned -> changesTuned[:] to be stricter?
- BetaPressure: one value?
- Add SemiGrand Canonical ensemble
+ GeneratingAlgorithms:
    - acceptationProbability(): uniformise comment notation
    - BoxesVolumeExchange: optimise overlap
- rewrite modules/index.md
- [High Priority] reset selectors just once
- data[JSON] to update
