- Exploration: more decoupling?
- Radial: to factorise
- BoxVolumeChange -> BoxSizeChange?
- ExploringAlgorithms: no Abstract?
- MaximumBoxCompression: avoid r_min /= min_distance confusion
- HardContact: NeighbourCells size must be increased: drawback
- DipolarVisitor: Self is scalable (instead of O(N)): is it worth it?
- In DESreciStructure & DESreciVisitor, document the role of boxVolumeMemento
- doc: \epsilon -> \varepsilon
- VolumeChange: + or - in observable?
