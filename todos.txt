- Exploration: more decoupling?
- Radial: to factorise
- BoxVolumeChange -> BoxSizeChange?
- ExploringAlgorithms: no Abstract?
- MaximumBoxCompression: avoid r_min /= min_distance confusion
- HardContact: NeighbourCells size must be increased: drawback
- DipolarVisitor: Self is scalable (instead of O(N)): is it worth it?
- In DESreciStructure & DESreciVisitor, document the role of boxVolumeMemento
- doc: permittivity: \epsilon -> \varepsilon
- VolumeChange: + or - in observable?
- Generalise ParticleInsertionMethod (Widom) for other ensembles, cf. FS02
- PeriodicBox: remove getMaxDistance() ?
- Convert all explorations for multiples boxes & components
- GEMC conversion: array by default: bad idea?
- PeriodicBox: add Null or throw error when numBoxes == 0
- ExploringAlgorithms: warning if unexpected ensemble
+ Multiple Boxes: ChangedBoxSizeRatio interdependance:
    - I choose to use a unique delta for boxes i and j. It seems reasonable
    since the same delta appears in the volume change acceptance probability.
- There are at least two versions of GEMC: ``Canonical'' & ``Isobaric''. I will
    implement the first one.
- [Data] Fortran code to update, cf. json
- ComponentAverageNumber: with actual average counting for GEMC
- docUML: reference (& notation) for aggregation (if a class is imported)?
- NeighbourCells: HS shortcut
+ GeneratingAlgorithms:
    - promote resetSelectors() in base class
    - locally: this%selector promote to this%selectors(numBoxes)?
- docUML: overloaded methods: same name (generic in Fortran)
