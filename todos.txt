- Hide DLC in EwaldReci?
- Exploration: more decoupling?
- Radial: to factorise
- BoxVolumeChange -> BoxSizeChange?
- ExploringAlgorithms: no Abstract?
- MaximumBoxCompression: avoid r_min /= min_distance confusion
- MaximumBoxCompression and VolumeChangeMethod in one pass?
- HardContact: NeighbourCells size must be increased: drawback
- DESrealPair: reset() if volume increases (Tabulated)
- PLMCvisit: visitShortEnergies(): cycle if VolumeChangeRatio > 1 && cells.size > potential.rMax
- DipolarVisitor: Self is scalable (instead of O(N)): is it worth it?
- In DESreciStructure & DESreciVisitor, document the role of boxVolumeMemento
- DipolarInteractionsFacade: reconnect (pointers)
- doc: \epsilon -> \varepsilon
- PLMCexplore: doesn't need initial volume delta
- domain: to unifiy
